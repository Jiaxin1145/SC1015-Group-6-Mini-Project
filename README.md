# SC1015-Group-6-Mini-Project
For our mini project in SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, we analysed on the Online Food [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudarshan24byte/online-food-dataset/data) from kaggle.
### Problem Definition
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that optimise online food order feedback by encouraging more positive ratings and minimise negative ratings. By analysing various factors influencing customer feedback, the goal is to identify strategies to increase overall positive feedback rates on the platform.
